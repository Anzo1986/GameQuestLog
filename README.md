## ✨ About The Project

GameQuestLog is not just a list—it's a **companion for your gaming journey**. Built with a premium, dark-mode-first design philosophy, it transforms the mundane task of backlog management into an engaging RPG-like experience.

Earn XP for every game you add, start, or finish. Level up your profile from a "Novice Adventurer" to a "Godlike Entity" as you conquer your library.

### Key Features

*   **🏆 Gamified Progression**: Earn XP and level up by managing your library. Watch your rank grow!
*   **📊 Comprehensive Dashboard**: Visualize your habits with beautiful charts (Playing vs. Completed, Genre DNA, Platform Wars).
*   **🧙‍♂️ Quest Giver**: Can't decide what to play? Let the "Quest Giver" roll the dice and pick a game from your backlog.
*   **📱 Mobile-First PWA**: Installable on iOS and Android. Features native-like smooth gestures (swipe-to-close) and touch-optimized UI.
*   **🎨 Dynamic Themes**: Customize the look with multiple color schemes (Blue, Pink, Green, Purple, Red, Orange).
*   **🪄 AI-Powered Updates**: Integrated with **Google Gemini** to fetch the latest patch notes and content updates for your active games.
